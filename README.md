We can start explain what is Devops Philosophy and how traditional companies worked and how are working in this moment. From Monolith to Microservices.

In this new scenario what does a Devops Engineer?

* Need to known how application is built
* Focus is related to operation of:
  * App Security
  * Operational readiness
  * Infrastructure
  * Testing


After explaining this new scenario we can expose our experience at SCRM. SCRM is a model that starts as a monolith (semi-traditional model) appplication without Ops ( no App security, no care about infrastructure) and now we are moving to a infrastructure with microservices.
